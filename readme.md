# Using automated text analysis to look for "welfare chauvnism" in EU legislation

We use the [CEPS-EURLEX dataset](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/0EGYWY), a large text dataset containing almost the entire corpus of EU legislation, to study whether EU legislation has recently shifted from emphasizing the free movement of workers and non-discrimination to allowing member states more leeway in limiting access to their social protection systems.

This is work in progress. First results are shown in `Slides_EURLEX_Presentation.pdf`.
